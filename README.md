Here's the overall sense of each part of the code:

1. **Text Preprocessing**:
   - The code starts by importing necessary libraries for text processing, including NLTK and SpaCy, and downloads required resources.
   - It then defines the input text that needs to be summarized.

2. **Tokenization and Stopword Removal**:
   - The input text is tokenized into sentences and words using NLTK and SpaCy.
   - Stopwords, which are common words that do not carry much significance, are removed from the tokenized words.

3. **Scoring Sentences**:
   - Each sentence is scored based on the frequency of important words it contains. This scoring helps identify the most important sentences in the text.

4. **Selecting Important Sentences**:
   - The top 30% of sentences with the highest scores are selected as the most important sentences. This threshold can be adjusted based on the desired summary length.

5. **Visualizing Important Sentences**:
   - The selected important sentences are visualized using a bar chart.
   - Each sentence is represented by a bar, with the important sentences highlighted in blue.

6. **Displaying Visualization**:
   - The final step is to display the bar chart, providing a graphical representation of the most important sentences in the text.

In summary, the code demonstrates a method to automatically summarize text by identifying key sentences and presents these important sentences visually for easier understanding and interpretation.
